    <h4 class="header secondary-color">Companion to Champion Model</h4>
    <p class="center-align banner-text">We developed a competency model to meet your specific learning needs based on what we know about Carnegie Mellon University. Each level of mastery corresponds with the expected, observable behavioral indicators for a particular competence area. It is important to note that your level of mastery does not equate to your position or place on an organizational chart. You develop your skills and abilities in a variety of ways and often beyond your role at CMU. We hope to assist you in recognizing your level of mastery and provide suggestions on how to build upon your abilities.</p>
